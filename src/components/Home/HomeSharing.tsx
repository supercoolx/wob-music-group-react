                <div className="pt-10">
                    Every month there will be royalties that will
                    be paid out from the WL&apos;s music distributor into the community Solana wallet. Part of those
                    royalties will be shared with various artists that helped to make the song and the remaining
                    royalties are going to go back into the project so we can invest in the project in various ways
                    with the number one goal being to benefit the WB Holders as much as possible.
