                    The remix artwork for each song will be sourced from the community. MegaWob
                    holders can submit their remix art to us and the team will choose the top 3
                    submissions to be put on the website for a vote. The community will then have 24
                    hours to vote on the best artwork and the one with the most votes will win and be
                    the art we use for the release.
